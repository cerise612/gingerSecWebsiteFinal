            GingerSec LLC is located in: Phoenix, AZ<br />

            <p>It is GingerSec LLC's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while
                operating our website. This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="www.gingersec.com"
                    id="privacyLink">www.gingersec.com</a> (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "www.gingersec.com"). We respect
                your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us
                through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information
                may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may
                disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect
                through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general
                rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our
                Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p>
            <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
            <p>Like most website operators, GingerSec LLC collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort
                that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
                referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. GingerSec LLC's purpose in collecting
                non-personally identifying information is to better understand how GingerSec LLC's visitors use its
                website. From time to time, GingerSec LLC may release non-personally-identifying information in the
                aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
            <p>GingerSec LLC also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
                addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on www.gingersec.com blog posts. GingerSec
                LLC only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses
                and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
            <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
            <p>Certain visitors to GingerSec LLC's websites choose to interact with GingerSec LLC in ways that require
                GingerSec LLC to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that
                GingerSec LLC gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up
                for a blog at www.gingersec.comto provide a username and email address.</p>
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission
                over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially
                acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
            <h2>Advertisements</h2>
            <p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.

                interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by GingerSec LLC and does not cover the

                Privacy Policy and terms and conditions of every site you visit.</p>

                policy.</p>
