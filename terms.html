                    provided You with sufficient notice of the variation. We are under no other
                    obligation to notify You of any variation to these terms and conditions. <br>
                    GOODS AND SERVICES <br>
                    10. QUOTES <br>
                    10.1 Term and effect: Quotes will only be valid for 7 days unless otherwise specified
                    in the Quote. A Quote is merely an invitation to You to place an Order with Us
                    and the acceptance of a Quote by You will not create a binding contract
                    between You and Us. <br>
                    10.2 Quote is valid for 7 days only. Expiry dates on quotes are set to be able to
                    inform Us when the quote is still active or to be discarded. Once discarded the
                    quote will need to be requested again. <br>
                    10.3 Once a quote has been confirmed by Us, then the prices in the quote will be
                    confirmed as the final agreed price. A quote is confirmed as 'final' as soon as
                    both parties agree with the final price after any last changes requested by You. <br>
                    10.4 The price in the final quote may vary from the original request if there is any
                    price or product changes requested by You. We reserve the right to alter
                    product and prices in the quote, as long as the quote has not been confirmed
                    with You. <br>
                    10.5 Quotes and estimates shall be deemed to correctly interpret the original
                    specifications and are based on the cost at the time the quote or estimate is
                    given. If You later require any changes to the quotes, and We agree to the
                    changes, these changes will be charged at Our prevailing rate. <br>
                    10.6 Once the Quote has been confirmed and converted to an Order, the Order will
                    be subjected to our normal Terms and Condition of Sale. <br>
                    10.7 The general minimum turnaround time for Quote request to be actioned is
                    usually 24 hours. In the event that a quote is required urgently please let us
                    know so that we can respond to it accordingly. <br>
                    10.8 When a special price or discount offer has been applied to this Quote, no other
                    special promotion, discount or bonus offer will be applicable. <br>
                    10.9 In the event that products in the Quote are subjected to any price and supply
                    fluctuations that is outside of Our control We reserve the right to update the
                    price and product in the Quote accordingly. If a product has undergone a price
                    drop or a price increase, the Quote will then be adjusted accordingly. If there is
                    a product that is no longer available, the product will then be replaced or
                    substituted based on Your request and is subject to Your final approval. <br>
                    10.10Price on non-stocked products are subjected to Price and stock fluctuations and
                    can only be confirmed once the Quote is turned into an Order. While We
                    endeavour to honour every price quoted, if there is a price increase that is
                    beyond our control, We reserve the right to increase the price as necessary. <br>
                    10.11Once a Quote has already passed the expired date, We may cancel the quote or
                    estimate without having to notify or receive an approval from You. <br>
                    10.12ETA information is based on an estimate given by our vendors and cannot be
                    held as the actual promised date. <br>
                    10.13Freight charges will be added to the Order unless otherwise stated. Any
                    included delivery charges are estimates only. <br>
                    10.14We do not keep inventory and as such only order items once we receive a
                    completed order from a client. If You would like to return an item or cancel an
                    order, a restocking fee may apply. We will need to get approval from the
                    distributor that the stock is returnable before being able to issue a refund as
                    not all products can be returned. <br>
                    10.15Prices are based upon total Quote Purchase. <br>
                    10.16Unless Specified, all items on quote are covered by manufacturer’s warranty
                    covering parts and labour for hardware only on a return to depot basis. <br>
                    10.17Varying or withdrawing Quotes: We may vary or withdraw a Quote at any time
                    in Our absolute discretion and without prior notice to You. We may do so for
                    any reason We consider fit, including, e.g. where the Goods or Services become
                    unavailable or the cost price of Goods or Services increases after the date of the
                    Quote. <br>
                    11. ORDERS <br>
                    11.1 Order forms: You may place an Order for Goods and/or Services with Us.
                    Normally, We will require that You provide either a completed Order form or
                    You approve the quote electronically via either an email or a web based system
                    with the date and Your details, including Your full legal name or description and
                    any applicable ABN or ACN number (including the full name or description of

                    any relevant Quote number and date. <br>
                    11.2 Approval of Orders: You will need to sign the Order or have it duly executed on
                    Your behalf, unless the Order is sent by email or via the web based ordering
                    system, in which case the Order will be treated or deemed as if signed by or on
                    behalf of You by the person whose name appears as the sender of the email or
                    submitter of the form. <br>
                    11.3 Reliance on appearance of validity: Absent actual knowledge to the contrary,
                    We may rely upon the apparent validity of an Order. If any Order is signed or
                    sent by email or approved through the web based ordering system by a named
                    person, that person warrants that the Order is, and it is acknowledged the Order
                    is deemed in favour of Us to be: <br>
                    11.3.1 signed by, and duly authorised by, both the person who signed the
                    Order and the person who sent the email; and <br>
                    11.3.2 duly authorised by the person on whose behalf the Order is placed or
                    apparently placed. <br>
                    11.4 Acceptance and Orders: An Order has no effect unless or until it is accepted by
                    You in writing and, until We have received from You payment in clear funds for
                    the Order and any related freight, delivery and (where applicable) in-transit
                    insurance costs in clear funds. <br>
                    11.5 No obligation to deliver: We are not obliged to deliver any Order until we have
                    received payment in clear funds from You for the Order, any related freight,
                    delivery and (where applicable) in-transit insurance costs or where We are
                    unwilling or unable to complete the Order for any reason provided it refunds
                    any payment made by You in respect of the Order. <br>
                    11.6 Credit checks: For the purposes of ascertaining the credit standing or history of
                    a prospective customer to whom We are considering extending credit or
                    payment terms, You hereby consents to Us undertaking a credit reference check
                    in respect to You. <br>
                    11.7 Cancellation of Orders: You will not cancel an Order unless We agree to do so in
                    writing in Our absolute discretion. You acknowledge that, amongst other
                    things, We cannot cancel an Order once the manufacturer or supplier has
                    despatched the relevant Goods and that such despatch often occurs the same
                    day as the Order is placed by Us. <br>
                    11.8 Processes and Procedures: We have processes and procedures that We follow in
                    the course of the provision of Our Services and the supply of Goods. You agree

                    processing the return or refund, or in processing the Order, the cancellation and
                    any refund. We may deduct the Return/Cancellation fee from out of any

                    from You before such expenses are incurred. <br>
                    12.7 Separate charges for Goods and Services: We may in Our absolute discretion
                    charge for Goods separately from Services or may charge for Goods and

                    12.9 Change in underlying costs: Without prejudice to any other rights of Ours under

                    to in the Rates Schedule and any Plan Schedule. We may withdraw the

                    without notice to You, from time to time in Our absolute discretion. <br>
                    13.2 Copies on Request: We will provide You with a copy of the current Rates
                    Schedule upon request. Plan Schedules are tailored for particular Plans and are

                    14. CONTRACTING <br>
                    14.1 We may subcontract any or all of the Services to be performed, but shall retain
                    prime responsibility for the Services under these terms. <br>
                    15. DELIVERY, TITLE AND RISK <br>
                    15.1 Delivery liability: We will use all reasonable endeavours to despatch Goods by
                    the due date, but do not accept any liability for non-delivery or failure to deliver
                    on time where this is caused by circumstances beyond the reasonable control of
                    Ours, including, for example, due to failures in supply to Us or delays caused by
                    third parties, such as delivery companies or manufacturers. <br>
                    15.2 Availability to accept delivery: You must be available to accept the Goods at
                    Your nominated delivery address during Business Hours unless otherwise
                    arranged. <br>
                    15.3 Passing of Risk: Delivery is deemed to take place when the Goods are delivered
                    to Your nominated address, whereupon risks of loss, breakage and all damage
                    and all other risks pass to You. Nothing in this clause 15.3 will affect title to the
                    Goods. <br>
                    15.4 Obligation to insure: You will ensure that Goods are adequately insured from
                    the time of delivery under clause 15.3. <br>
                    15.5 Retention of Title: Until We receive full payment in cleared funds for any
                    moneys due to Us by You on any account or for any reason: <br>
                    15.5.1 title to, and property in, Goods supplied to You remain vested in
                    Us and does not pass to You; <br>
                    15.5.2 You must hold those Goods as fiduciary bailee and agent for Us and
                    must not sell them; <br>
                    15.5.3 You must keep those Goods separate from other goods and maintain
                    the Goods and their labelling and packaging intact; <br>
                    15.5.4 Where You sell the goods in breach of these Conditions, You are
                    required to hold the proceeds of any sale of those Goods on trust for Us
                    in a separate account (however any failure to do so will not affect Your
                    obligation to deal with the proceeds as trustee and remit them to Us); <br>
                    15.5.5 We may, without prior notice, enter into any premises where We suspect
                    those Goods may be, take possession of those Goods and sever and
                    remove those Goods (notwithstanding that they may have been
                    attached to other goods not the property of Ours) and for this purpose,
                    You hereby irrevocably authorise and direct Us (and Our employees and
                    agents) to enter into such premises as its duly authorised agent and You

                    FITNESS FOR PURPOSE <br>
                    17.1 Service limitations given the science of computing: You acknowledge that a
                    reasonable incident of the Services may involve trial and error and that it is a
                    science applied often in novel or unknown circumstances and involving
                    experiment. In particular, You acknowledge that the Services may involve tests,
                    troubleshooting, advice and recommendations that may prove incorrect or
                    inappropriate, particularly in an attempt to cure a problem You are having.
                    While We will make what We consider (in Our absolute discretion) to be all
                    reasonable endeavours to provide appropriate tests, troubleshooting, sound
                    advice and good recommendations in order to assist You, You will always
                    indemnify and hold Us harmless in the provision of our Services to You. <br>
                    17.2 Reasonable Assistance Limits: We are only obliged to provide what We
                    consider, in Our absolute discretion, to be reasonable assistance in the
                    circumstances (including with the installation and customisation of new
                    software or hardware for You or any other Work) under any Plan and You will
                    pay for additional work at the Rates unless otherwise agreed. Without limiting
                    the discretion of Us to determine what reasonable assistance is, normally,
                    reasonable assistance is limited to work done during Business Hours over a
                    period of time not exceeding any period that We have allowed or allows for the
                    Work or has estimated or estimates the Work will take, whether or not notice of
                    the time allowed or estimated is given by Us to You. <br>
                    17.3 Recommendations, suitability, functionality and fitness for purpose: The parties
                    acknowledge that: <br>
                    17.3.1 We may recommend that You purchase Goods provided by third
                    parties from time to time; <br>
                    17.3.2 Recommendations may be made in situations where You have made
                    known to Us the purpose for which the Goods will be used or some
                    function sought to be fulfilled; <br>
                    17.3.3 You acknowledge that We have no control over many factors involved
                    with the suitability, function or fitness for purpose of Goods in an
                    existing or new computer environment, e.g. <br>
                    17.3.3.1 the compatibility or ability of the Goods to fit into or perform
                    to expectations in the receiving computer/internet
                    environment; or <br>
                    17.3.3.2 the behaviour of third party supplier, e.g. in relation to
                    support; <br>
                    17.3.4 You acknowledge that for a whole number of reasons outside of Our
                    control, the Goods may fail to meet Your expectations, may not turn
                    out to be fit for all or any of the purposes sought, may not be suitable
                    or may not function properly in all or any respects; <br>
                    17.3.5 You acknowledge that the Services provided by Us may involve the very
                    task of seeking to customise Goods so they may be fit for particular
                    purposes and that customisation may be a very substantial project in
                    itself; <br>
                    17.3.6 Accordingly You will accept the sole responsibility for, and indemnify

                    17.3.6.1 decisions as to whether or not to follow recommendations by
                    Us; <br>
                    17.3.6.2 decisions as to whether or not to purchase or customise
                    Goods or obtain Services for that or any other purpose; and <br>
                    17.3.6.3 any failure or defect in suitability, function or fitness for
                    purpose of any Goods and/or Services, including a
                    responsibility to obtain Your own independent advice or
                    second opinion from a suitably qualified person; <br>

                    suitability, function or fitness for purpose (whether expressed, agreed
                    or otherwise), You must pay for those Services on time without any setoff or counter-claim, whether
                    or not We are able to achieve any of such
                    purposes, suitability, function or fitness for purpose, provided always
                    that We have acted in good faith and have made what We consider, in
                    Our absolute discretion, to have made all reasonable endeavours to
                    achieve those outcomes. <br>
                    17.4 Testing Procedures: You will follow the instructions of Ours with regard to
                    testing or troubleshooting any problems and that if those do not resolve the
                    outstanding problems, We will, subject to these Conditions, allocate such
                    resources as We consider reasonable in the circumstances towards their
                    resolution. <br>
                    18. FORCE MAJEURE <br>
                    18.1 Force Majeure: If We are unable to supply any Goods or Services due to
                    circumstances beyond Our reasonable control, We may cancel the Order (even
                    if the Order has already been accepted) or cease to provide the Services by
                    written notice to You, in which case You will hold Us harmless. <br>
                    18.2 We will not be liable for any breach of contract due to any matter or thing
                    beyond Our control, including failures by third parties to supply goods, services

                    Court). <br>
                    30.2 You agree that Our damages resulting from breach of this clause 30.1 would
                    be impracticable and that it would be extremely difficult for Us to ascertain the

                    as liquidated damages and We shall have the option to terminate this
                    Agreement without further notice or liability to You. The amount of liquidated
                    damages reflected herein is not intended as a penalty and is reasonably
                    calculated based upon the projected costs We would incur to identify, recruit,
                    hire and train suitable replacements for such personnel. <br>
